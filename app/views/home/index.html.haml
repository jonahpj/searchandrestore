      %p Search And Restore is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization dedicated to developing and uniting the audience for new jazz music. We organize concerts and festivals, as well as this website which currently serves as a home for concert listings for the jazz scene in New York City. 

      %p Now, after an inspiring Kickstarter fundraiser for $75,000 , we're working on a new and improved website. Throughout 2011 we're going to film 200 concerts throughout the city, and a lot, lot more.
